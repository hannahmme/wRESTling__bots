# wRESTling bots

wRESTling bots is a Java/ Javascript library for chatting on a webserver with other clients.


## Running the program

To run the program, you should
1. execute the "Oblig2DatSkyApplication" program found in /main/java/API
2. open SERVER_URL: 'http://localhost:8080' in your preffered webbrowser

We recommend running this application from IntelliJ IDE, since this is the IDE the application has been developed in.



## Usage

When the webbrowser is open and the application is running you can register as a user from the first page.
Your unique userID will then be generated by the application and ensures the control of who sent which messages.

After making a new chatroom and joining it or joining an existing one, you can either send a message to the room,
go back to the mainpage but wtill be a part of the room, log out from the application or deregsiter from the room.
By deregistering from the room, you will not receive any more notifications from new messages in that room.


## Server

The server is a Spring Boot application created with Spring Initializr.
We have added the "Spring Reactive Web" dependency ++???.



## Client
There will be four bots implemented in the application from the start. These will answer questions, can delete chatrooms or kick out other clients if they misbehave. ???????


## Libraries
We are using Java version 14 with the Spring Boot framework and jUnit.

In the making of this application we have used of the Bootstrap-library for designing the GUI.
