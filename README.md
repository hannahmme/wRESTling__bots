# wRESTling bots
wRESTling bots is a Java/ Javascript library for chatting on a webserver with other clients.

## Running the program
To run the program, you should
1. execute the "Oblig2DatSkyApplication" program found in /main/java/API
2. open SERVER_URL: 'http://localhost:8080' in your preferred web browser

We recommend running this application from IntelliJ IDE, since this is the IDE the application has been developed in.

## Usage
When the web browser is open and the application is running you can register as a user from the first page.
Your unique userID will then be generated by the application and ensures the control of who sent which messages.

After making a new chat room and joining it or joining an existing one, you can either send a message to the room,
go back to the main page but still be a part of the room, log out from the application or deregister from the room. 
If you write a message including one of the following greetings or actions: "hi", "hello", "howdy", "yo", "eat", "sing",
"dance", "run", one of the bots will reply with an adequate answer, while the other bots will answer with simple 
messages like "hi".

You can log out of the application by clicking the "Log out"-button either from the main page or inside a chat room. 
Your user will then be removed from the chat rooms you are registered in and from the application's list of registered 
users. 

## Server
The server is a Spring Boot application created with Spring Initializr.

## Client
The client program is connecting to the server through a GUI in a web browser.
There will be four bots implemented in the application from the start. These will write messages and reply to messages 
from other users in the chat rooms.

## Libraries
We are using Java version 14 with the Spring Boot framework.
In the making of this application we have used the Bootstrap-library for designing the GUI.

## Remaining Task 3 
We could not connect websocket to localhost, and could not find the reason. Therefore the function behind the button 
for turning on notifications in the chat rooms does not work.
